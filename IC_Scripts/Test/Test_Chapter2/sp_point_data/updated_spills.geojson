Based on pressure data from surrounding shut-in wells, it appears that the Sebold B1 wellhead valve has been damaged or deteriorated during the 3-year shut-in and leaked into the flowline. This leaking wellhead valve overpressured the flowline above the maximum operating pressure associated with the HDPE poly pipe and the pipe failed at a fused joint.

Poly pipe does not corrode and is compatible with the materials KPK produces. This flowline replacement occurs at the leak point and typically goes in both directions of the flowline for many hundreds of feet to the closest section of existing plastic pipe for connection. KPK typically slips this poly pipe inside the existing steel flowline to provide additional benefits/functionality going forward such as: secondary containment; protection from physical damage by subsequent subsurface digging; and provide the ability to use magnetic locating equipment to identify the flowline location.   At this spill point, KPK is excavating the steel 2.5-inch flowline from the joint with plastic and replacing the flowline eastward all the way to the header. This will prevent any future corrosion issues on this flowline. The pre-existing polypipe coming from the wellhead to the west is believed to be poly beneath the adjacent stormwater ditch and fiberglass to the wellhead.  KPK has developed and submitted a comprehensive Flowline Integrity Management Plan in collaboration and multiple reviews/edits with the ECMC Flowline Integrity Group (attached herein). KPK follows this plan to maintain flowline integrity and employs flowline replacement as the primary preventative measure. For risk mitigation and the elimination of threats to flowline integrity, KPK refers to API Recommended Practice 1160, Section 10. KPK also contracted Multi-Chem® to conduct an analysis of chemical contributors to corrosion on steel flowlines.

KPK follows this plan to maintain flowline integrity and employs flowline replacement as the primary preventative measure.  KPK has contracted Multi-Chem® to conduct an analysis of chemical contributors to corrosion on steel flowlines. The conclusion was that corrosion inhibitor was not needed and the recommendation going forward was to inject a biocide into separators to mitigate microbial corrosive action where microbial activity may be a contributing factor. Multi-Chem® also concluded that KPK should inject a paraffin inhibitor into specific wells within the system depending on need. KPK injects paraffin into a select list of wells as monitored and recorded by the production team.
