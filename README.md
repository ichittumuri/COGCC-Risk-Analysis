FlowlineSpreadsheet_Mines:
- This spreadsheet is a record of the individually-registered lines. So these have two pieces of helpful information as they aren't directly connected to any GIS. Using the start and end point lat/longs, these individual facilities can be connected with the (unconnected) GIS via simple merge. The attributes exclusively found on the form can be connected to spatial data as you see fit.
- While we do have other flowline system facilities data, these cannot be connected on a 1:1 basis the same way (no lat/longs). 

Flowline-Related Spills (2022):
- This is (as mentioned on monday) the refined spills list. If you require extra data, you could always run lookup via 'trkg_num' through the most-recent data https://ecmc.state.co.us/documents/data/downloads/environmental/SpillsDownload.html.
- Primarily, the field you'll want to use is 'Root Cause Type' and I included the lat/longs obviously. Also attached are our definitions of those failure modes.
